                <h1>CIT 230 -&nbsp;Web Frontend Development</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>This course focuses on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other web development basics. There is a lot to learn quickly. If you are new to web development, especially HTML and CSS, you might consider taking WDD 100 to help you prepare for this course. WDD 100 is not required for CIT 230, but it will help you be prepared. In addition, about 2/3 of students have had or are taking a programming course (CIT 160) - this seems to make a difference in their success in this course, particularly when working with JavaScript.</p>

                <p class="callout">This is a technical class, not a design class. It will require between 9-12 hours per week. Even though it may be challenging, you will be successful as long as you are diligent and work hard. You are required to collaborate with your classmates in order to support and help one another.</p>

                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p>When building web sites, successful web developers must consider all of the following: audience, organization, interface, usability, content, layout, and visual (aesthetic) design. This course will teach you to plan, design, and construct web sites to work properly in modern web browsers and conform to web standards while following best practices.</p>
                <h2>Keys to Success</h2>
                <p>To be successful in this course you will need to have the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strong work ethic</li>
                    <li>Ability to learn and apply what you learn</li>
                    <li>Ability to solve problems</li>
                    <li>Ability to meet deadlines</li>
                    <li>Ability to work well with others &mdash; supporting, communicating, teaching, and learning from them</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Materials</h2>
                <p>To be successful in this course you&rsquo;ll need the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A computer with 8GB of RAM (recommended), 64-bit operating system, and wireless capability.</li>
                    <li>Code editor &mdash; <a title="Download Brackets - link opens in a new tab" href="http://brackets.io/" target="_blank">Brackets text editor</a>&nbsp;(free software for Mac and Windows) is recommended.</li>
                    <li>GitHub account and Desktop Client &mdash; To store and manage web resources for the course. Will be introduced in week 2 of the course.</li>
                    <li>SitePoint Premium account. Purchase an account voucher from the BYU-Idaho Bookstore for $11. Then use the provided link that accompanies the voucher to create your account.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Course Objectives</h2>
                <p>These objectives are based on web standards and best practices to help you be successful in the future.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Develop web pages that are <a title="Read about semantics on html5doctor.com" href="//html5doctor.com/lets-talk-about-semantics/" target="_blank">semantic</a> and valid using the HTML5 markup language.</li>
                    <li>Style web pages with valid Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) level 3 and avoid all HTML presentational markup.</li>
                    <li>Provide content that is visually appropriate, usable, and findable to humans and machines.</li>
                    <li>Plan, design, and develop web pages and sites according to best practices of organization and maintainability.</li>
                    <li>Work with JavaScript to handle events and interactions within the browser including JSON and remote API's.</li>
                    <li>Work effectively with others in a work environment by communicating clearly, fulfilling assignments and meeting deadlines.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Frameworks and Templates</h2>
                <p class="callout">Note: This is a web course intended to help you learn how to construct web sites using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. Outside templates are not allowed (except as introduced in the course). Pages built from site builder software, frameworks, templates or drag-n-drop tools are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed.</p>

                <h2>Know, Do, Become</h2>
                <p>This course is the first step to becoming a web developer - which requires you to both know and do. In order to know something, you must study, reflect, and practice. To do requires effort and application to implement your knowledge. If you consistently do this you are on your way to becoming what you desire.</p>

                <h2>Collaboration</h2>
                <p>During this class, you will form and work with learning teams. These teams will be a primary resource for mutual support and feedback. Before you turn anything in, get feedback from your team. &nbsp;This kind of team structure is similar to what you will find in the workplace.</p>
                <p>You will start organizing your team during week 01 while you are introducing yourself to your classmates. Look for others you can collaborate with. It is vital that you coordinate schedules and identify times that you are available to meet with your peers.</p>

                <h2>Assessments</h2>
                <p>Each class assessment relates to one or more course objectives, indicated in brackets. Due dates are listed in the course schedule. Each assessment will be submitted as specified in its description. Once posted, an assessment should remain unchanged until graded, with the grade appearing in the grade book. Each assessment will be graded using the provided grading matrix. It is <b>YOUR</b> responsibility to thoroughly read and understand the specification for each assessment and test your own product for compliance to the stated criteria. Peer review, feedback and correction using the grading matrix prior to the due date is encouraged.</p>

                <!--
    <h2>Teaching Presentation [Objectives 3 &amp; 6]</h2>
    <p>You will create a 7-minute <a href="/230v2/presentations/overview.html" title="Read the overview of teaching presentations" target="_blank">teaching presentation</a> that you will share with the class. Visit <a href="/230v2/presentations/topics.html" title="Look at the list of teaching presentations" target="_blank">Teaching Topic Presentation List&nbsp;</a>for a list of topics and guidelines on signing up. Carefully review the <a href="/230v2/presentations/grading_matrix.html" target="_blank" title="Review the teaching presentation grading matrix">Teaching Presentation Grading Matrix</a>&nbsp;for grading details.</p>

    <p>The presentation can be created using a presentation software like PowerPoint or Keynote, or using a web-based program like Prezi, Haiku Deck, Google Slides or a web page of your own construction.</p>
-->

                <h2>Weekly Assessments [Varied]</h2>
                <p>Each week you will have a variety of assessments, including quizzes, to allow you to solve problems and apply the concepts discussed in the class. Each assessment includes its own grading matrix which should be carefully reviewed prior to submission. Team collaboration is encouraged while completing each assessment.</p>

                <h2>Web Site Project [All Objectives]</h2>
                <p>The <a href="../project/requirements.html" title="Read the requirements for the web site project" target="_blank">Web Site Project</a> will be your major project for the course. It will require an implementation of all the skills and technologies covered by the course. This is a major aspect of the course and will require substantial time and effort. Team collaboration is encouraged while completing the site project.</p>

                <h2>Getting Help</h2>
                <p>For many students learning HTML, CSS and many of the tools and techniques of this course is equivalent to learning a foreign language. For 99% of students, it is not a matter of "if", but rather "when" you will need help. There are a number of mechanisms built into the course so you can get help. They are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learning Teams &mdash; This is a small group of your peers, enrolled in the same class, doing the same preparations, activities and assessments. You should interact with this group frequently &mdash; ask questions, share insights, read one another&rsquo;s work, make comments and suggestions. Learn how to work together and support one another. This is a very powerful and useful model &mdash; one that is used in the web design and development industry.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Weekly Discussion Board &mdash; where you can ask and answer questions, ask for clarification and share insights (collaborate) with your peers. This is an avenue to maintain communications outside of class. The professor and the teaching assistants will monitor the board and offer help when appropriate. However, the primary intent is for class members to help one another using this tool. Don&rsquo;t underestimate the importance of these activities to your learning.</li>
                    <li>The Professor &mdash; Feel free to make an appointment to visit with me at <a href="//calendly.com/thompsonda" title="View my office times in a new tab" target="_blank">calendly.com/thompsonda</a> or visit with me in class.</li>
                    <li>Teaching Assistant &mdash; A TA is available in-class with whom you can visit and get help.</li>
                    <li>CIT Web Lab &mdash; STC 347 is open for a limited number of hours each week with a TA available to help on a first come, first serve basis. The lab hours will be made available usually during the second week of the semester.</li>
                    <li>Tutoring Center &mdash; The BYU-Idaho tutoring center hires tutors to meet and assist students. Visit the tutoring center web site to check availability and schedule an appointment.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Grading</h2>

                <p>The final percentage will determine your grade as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>A</strong> 93.00%-100%</li>
                    <li><strong>A-</strong> 90.00%-92.99%</li>
                    <li><strong>B+</strong> 87.00%-89.99%</li>
                    <li><strong>B </strong> 83.00%-86.99%</li>
                    <li><strong>B-</strong> 80.00%-82.99%</li>
                    <li><strong>C+</strong> 77.00%-79.99%</li>
                    <li><strong>C </strong> 73.00%-76.99%</li>
                    <li><strong>C-</strong> 70.00%-72.99%</li>
                    <li><strong>D+</strong> 67.00%-69.99%</li>
                    <li><strong>D</strong> 63.00%-66.99%</li>
                    <li><strong>D- </strong> 60.00%-62.99%</li>
                    <li><strong>F </strong> below 60%</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Grades will be assessed using the <a href="http://www.byui.edu/student-records/grades/grading-system" target="_blank">University Grading Guidelines</a>. Remember that completing the bare minimum for an assignment will not earn you an 'A'!</p>
                <p>Your final grade in this course will be based on your performance in the following categories:</p>
                <table border="1" cellpadding="3" style="width: 330px;">
                    <tbody>

        <p>Assessments are graded by the professor or teaching assistant (TA) and a score given for each of the listed course objectives. Passing course objectives determines the final course grade. Read about <a href="/230v2/course/grading.html" title="Link opens in a new tab" target="_blank">how to check your grade</a> in class.</p>

    <p>At the conclusion of the course, each course objective is graded Pass/Fail. To pass an objective, you must earn at least 80% of the points allocated to it. It is critical that you are always doing your best work, on time and error free &mdash; do not submit junk! You must follow the directions to have work graded.</p>
