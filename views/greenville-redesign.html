				<h1>Greenville Redesign</h1>
				<hr class="rulestyle">
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>For the activity this week I want you to image the following scenario:</p>
                <p>You eagerly await the next meeting with the client.  You have just finished the first prototype of the weather app you are building for them and you feel like you have nailed it! Everything is just as they requested...you are certain they will love it.</p>
                <p>You enter the meeting and bring up the new webpage to wak the client through it.  At the end though, instead of the words of praise you expected to hear, there is silence.  After an uncomfortable pause your client begins, "That is nice and all, but it's not quite what we had imagined.  Can you make a few changes?"</p>
                <p>After talking for a few minutes more you determine that the "few changes" they have in mind is basically a complete redesign. :(</p>
                <div class="callout">
                    <h3>Does that really happen?</h3>
                    <p>You may be wondering how fictional my "fictional" situation above is.  Does that really happen? In the words of Phineas of Phineas and Ferb: "Yes, yes it does."  I've often found that clients rarely know exactly what it is they want when you ask them, but they always know what they <em>don't</em> want <em>after</em> you have built it and shown it to them :)</p>
                    <p>This is honestly why the planning phase of a project is so critical...it helps the client gain a much clearer idea of what they need <em>before</em> you spend time coding.  You will find yourself re-doing stuff far less often if you plan.  That doesn't mean this will never happen.  Sometimes even after carefully thinking through an idea the reality just doesn't match the idea in your client's head and they will want to see alternatives.</p>
                </div>
                <h2>Tasks</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Imagine your client has asked for another option for the layout and design of the weather app you are building for them.  The first step in doing that is to develop new wireframes to represent the new layout. Review the Franklin weather page we finished up last week to remind yourself of all the content that is expected on each weather page.</li>
                    <li><p>Create a small and large version wireframe of a new and improved weather app page.  Make sure that you include all of the same content that was on the Franklin page for the small and large views. You can make your wireframe just about any way you would like.  you can use a dedicated software program like <a href="https://wireframe.cc" target="_blank">wireframe.cc</a>, Word, Powerpoint, Paint, any image editing software, or even a napkin (make sure your lines are dark enough to see all the detail if you draw it).  You just need to be able to produce a link or image of it to turn it in.</p>
                    <p>Make sure to consider the design principles you have learned about in the readings as you design your wireframes.</p>
                    
                    </li>
                    <li><p>The client would also like to see different fonts and colors chosen, and wouldn't even mind seeing it re-branded.  Spend some time looking over <a href="https://fonts.google.com" target="_blank">fonts</a> and choose two. One for the headlines, and one for other text.  You should also spend some time either on <a href="http://paletton.com/" target="_blank">Paletton.com</a>, or <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/" target="_blank">Adobe Color</a> and choose a new color scheme.</p>
                    <p>Optional: if you would like you can also re-brand the site...new name and logo.</p></li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Open the weather site planning page that we completed earlier in the semester in your editor.  Add a new section at the bottom called "Greenville Redesign" and add the following content to that section: fonts, colors, wireframes (can be either an image or a link), branding (optional).  Add an external stylesheet to the page so that you can style those new portions.</p>
                        <div class="callout">
                            <p>What does that mean "style those new portions"?  When we converted the planning document originally we didn't know any CSS, and so we used images to see what things should look like in certain portions.  This time we should use CSS to show that same thing.  For example to show what our body font looks like we might have the following HTML:</p>
                            <pre><code class="html">
&lt;section class="body-font"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Body Copy Font: Helvetica&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A B C Ć Č D Đ E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S Š T U V W X Y Z Ž a b c č ć d đ e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s š t u v w x y z ž 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 ‘ ? ’ “ ! ” ( % ) [ # ] { @ } &amp; &lt; - + ÷ × = &gt; ® © $ € £ ¥ ¢ : ; , . *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum nonsed eicillabore essum fugit lantisit, si nis eictia num fugiam et quatquis resto eossitem quunt quae sit dolupis maio omnimo il id maio bea ipid que conseque volorem. Et facidebit vel ma doluptasitis num, ullandebit hicto beaquos tiumquis postrum cori odit eosam quiatur? Volo quid minvel earuptatem quiatur?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
                            </code></pre>
                            <p>to which you might add the following CSS:</p>
                            <pre><code class="css">
.body-font {
    font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;                           
}
                            </code></pre>
                            <p>The result would be a working example of what the font will look like one the page.</p>
                            <p>Do the same for the colors...create colored boxes with html and CSS. Place the hexidecimal color code below each box. Here is an example of how that might look:</p>
                            <pre><code class="html">
&lt;section class="colors"&gt;
    &lt;div class="color-swatch"&gt;
        &lt;div class="color-swatch__color color-swatch__primary"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="color-swatch__description"&gt;
          &lt;h4&gt;Primary&lt;/h4&gt;
          &lt;small&gt;#A6D8DB&lt;/small&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="color-swatch"&gt;
        &lt;div class="color-swatch__color color-swatch__secondary"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="color-swatch__description"&gt;
          &lt;h4&gt;Secondary&lt;/h4&gt;
          &lt;small&gt;#F07C6C&lt;/small&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
                            </code></pre>
                            <pre><code class="css">
.colors {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-around;
    flex-flow: row wrap;
}
.color-swatch {
    border: 1px solid;
    border-radius: 10px;
    flex: 0 1 25%;
}
.color-swatch__color {
    width: 100%;
    height: 80px;
    border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;
}
.color-swatch__primary {
    background-color: #A6D8DB;
}
.color-swatch__secondary {
    background-color: #F07C6C;
}
.color-swatch__description {
    padding: .5em;
}
</code></pre>
                       <p>Feel free to use my example or come up with your own way to style the color swatches. If you use my example take a minute to figure out what each line in the CSS does and why the HTML is structured the way it is.</p>
                        </div>   
                    </li>
                    <li>Show your plans to at least one other classmate and ask them for feedback.  Add one more section to your plan and record their suggestions and your response there.</li>
                    <li>Validate your page for HTML and CSS. Fix <strong>all</strong> errors.</li>
                    <li>Make sure the link on your temporary homepage to this page still works.  Then make sure to commit and sync your work in Github Desktop.  Check your URL (should look like githubusername.github.io) to make sure all of your changes show, and to check that your images all work.</li>
                </ol>
