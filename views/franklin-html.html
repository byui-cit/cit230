				<h1>Getting started - Franklin</h1>
				<hr class="rulestyle">
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Last week we were introduced to the Planning Document for our weather site and we gained some experience working with HTML.  We also had a chance to practice converting wireframes into HTML.  Now we are ready to begin building our weather site by creating the Franklin page by following the wireframe in the planning document.</p>
                <div class="callout">
                    <h3>Which Wireframe?</h3>
                    <p>As we are getting ready to start you may be wondering which of the two wireframes should we follow?  The answer is both!  Since we are concentrating on getting the content off of the wireframe and into HTML we need to make sure we get <em>all</em> of the content.  Some content will be hidden on either the large or small screen, so if we just look at one or the other we might miss something.</p>
                </div>
                <h2>Tasks</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Review the <a href="../images/planning/wireframe-sm.png" target="_blank">small</a> and <a href="../images/planning/wireframe-lg.png" target="_blank">large</a> wireframes to get an idea of what we need to do.  Keep them handy as we will be referring back them often.</li>
                    <li>Create a new html document in your editor and save it in the weather folder with a name that keeps in mind the <a href="https://blainerobertson.github.io/230d2l/resources/naming.html" target="_blank">naming rules</a> we talked about earlier for the Franklin page of our site.</li>
                    <li><p>Start your page by adding all of the critical parts of a valid HTML5 webpage: doctype, html, head, metas, title, body, etc.  Or you can use the code below as a starting point.</p>
                    <pre><code class="html">
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en-us"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
         &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
          &lt;title&gt;My first website&lt;/title&gt;
          &lt;meta name="description" content="Short Description of the page."&gt;
          &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;  
                    </code></pre>
                        <p>If you are unsure what <em>any</em> of those lines do...make sure to revisit your notes or the readings from this unit. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp" target="_blank">W3schools</a> is a great resource as well.  You might consider moving through the first few pages of the reference linked above if parts of the code above are unclear.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Let's continue by changing the <code>title</code> and <code>description</code> to something that makes more sense for your page. Both of these elements are actually really important for <a href="https://moz.com/blog/visual-guide-to-keyword-targeting-onpage-optimization" target="_blank">Search Engine Optimization</a> (SEO).  This is the ability of search engines to figure out what your page is about.</p>
                        <p>Ideally your title should contain the name of the current page, the name of the site, and some keywords that describe what the site is about.  Here is a short video on <a href="https://youtu.be/94omQRmaRA4" target="_blank">Titles</a> that explains more. </p>
                        <p>The description should do just what it says...describe what the site...and particularly this page are about.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Now we are ready to start adding our content.  but first we need to create spaces in our HTML for that content to go. HTML is considered a <a href="https://blainerobertson.github.io/230d2l/resources/semantics.html" target="_blank">Semantic</a> language.  Basically the html markup use should <em>describe</em> the content it contains whenever possible.</p>
                        <p>Lets add a few semantic elements to get us started.  Most documents have the same underlying parts.  Most of us learned those when learning to write our first 5 paragraph essay. They are: header, main body, and footer.</p>
                        <p>HTML5 provided us with elements to represent those parts.  Lets add the following to our html. this should go in the body, replacing the h1 that is currently there (remember that the <code>body</code> contains all the stuff we want to be in the browser window.</p>
                        <pre><code class="html">
    &lt;header&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Mobile Weather App Site Plan&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;nav&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;

    &lt;/main&gt;
    &lt;footer&gt;
        &amp;copy;2017 Your name here
    &lt;/footer&gt;
                        </code></pre>
                        
                        <div class="callout">
                            <p>You may be saying to yourself at this point "this sounds very familiar..." and you would be right.  The last few steps are exactly what we did last week when creating the HTML version of the planning document.  This is not an accident, turns out that there is a certain amount of repetition in web development.  The core of an HTML document is really very similar from site to site.</p>
                            <p>Because of this many developers will create what is know as 'boilerplate' code.  It is a simple version of an HTML project that has all of the parts that are almost always used.  There is even an addon in Brackets that will provide you with these templates.  The boilerplate that I tend to use looks like this:</p>
                            <pre><code class="html">
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en-us"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
         &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
          &lt;title&gt;Page | Website | Keywords&lt;/title&gt;
          &lt;meta name="description" content="Short Description of the page."&gt;
          &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt;
          &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css" &gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;header&gt;
            &lt;nav&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;/nav&gt;    
        &lt;/header&gt;
        &lt;main&gt;

        &lt;/main&gt;
        &lt;footer&gt;
            &amp;copy;2017 Your name here
        &lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;  
                    </code></pre>
                       <p>Most of that should look familiar.  There are two lines we have not discussed yet in the <code>head</code>.  The <code>link</code> element and the viewport <code>meta</code>.  We will learn about those next week.  Feel free to use my boilerplate, or come up with your own with the things that you find you always want in an HTML page.</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>From here we are ready to continue adding content areas.  Everything else should go in the <code>header</code>, <code>main</code>, or <code>footer</code> elements we added. As you add content pay attention to what type of information it is and try to use the appropriate HTML element.</p>
                        <p>Make sure to refer often to the wireframes to make sure you don't miss anything. </p>
                        <div class="callout">
                            <p>I would recommend starting with outlining content areas...start general and work towards specifics. For example if we look at the <a href="../images/planning/wireframe-lg.png" target="_blank">large</a> wireframe you will notice that we have a good start on the general content areas.  But if we look specifically at the main content we see that we need to carve out more defined spaces for things.  We need 3 more containers inside of <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> in fact...one for current conditions, one for the location and temperature, and one for hourly information. You may want to refer to the <a href="https://blainerobertson.github.io/230d2l/resources/sectioning_flowchart.html" target="_blank">sectioning flowchart</a> to help you decide which elements you should use to define those areas.</p>
                            <p>After you define those 3 areas, look specifically at the center box.  It seems to be divided into a couple more areas...one for the location, and then another for the temp and high and low.  Add elements to contain those bits of content.</p>
                        </div>
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once you have all of the content areas defined go back and add the actual content to the correct area.  Again at this point you should be using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp" target="_blank">links</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp" target="_blank">images</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp" target="_blank">lists</a>, and lots of <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_paragraphs.asp" target="_blank">paragraphs</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_headings.asp" target="_blank">headlines</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Validate your page.  The easiest way to do this would be to use the Developer tools you installed in the first week.  You should see a little gear icon on the top right side of your browser if they are installed. Click on the gear, then Tools and if you are working locally (URL looks like: 127.0.0.1) then pick the "Validate Local HTML" option. If you have already uploaded your html to Github and want to validate there (URL looks like username.github.io) then pick the Validate HTML option.  Fix <strong>all</strong> errors.</li>
                    <li>Make sure to add a link to your temporary homepage to this new page.  Then make sure to commit and sync your work in Github Desktop.  Check your URL (should look like githubusername.github.io) to make sure all of your changes show, and to check that your images all work.</li>
                </ol>
