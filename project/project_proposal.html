				<h1>Project Proposal</h1>

				<p>The scope and functionality of the project will be determined by you and described in a project proposal. The finished project must demonstrate your mastery of building a responsive, valid html and css website that makes appropriate use of JavaScript and/or JQuery along with data from JSON file(s). Usability concepts to meet the needs of users and design principles to enhance the appearance of the web site are also expected.</p>
				<p>The final proposal must thoroughly describe the project to be built, including:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>The purpose of the project from a content delivery point of view.</li>
					<li>The target audience and persona for the project;</li>
					<li>A list and description of the web pages to be built (minimum of 5 content pages).</li>
					<li>Two wireframe sketches of a typical content page for small and large screens. Be sure to add detail to the sketches to clearly indicate the type of content (text, images, video, etc...) and layout on various devices.</li>
					<li>A light Style Guide including a minimum of a Typography section and colors section.</li>
					<li>Be a valid HTML document.</li>
					<li>Be submitted to the Project Proposal dropbox during week 07.</li>

				</ol>
				<p>You should continue with the web page produced in part one of this assignment and add the additional sections outlined above.</p>

				<p>Professor response will be in one of the following forms:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Approved</strong> – you may proceed with the project as proposed.</li>
					<li><strong>Modify</strong> – you must make modifications to the project proposal as indicated and resubmit the modified proposal to the professor.</li>
					<li><strong>Denied</strong> – the project does not meet the requirements or is too large or small of scope. You must submit a new proposal.</li>
