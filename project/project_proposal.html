				<h1>Project Proposal</h1>

				<p>The scope and functionality of the project will be determined by you and described in a project proposal. The finished project must demonstrate your mastery of building a responsive, valid html and css website that makes appropriate use of JavaScript and/or JQuery along with data from JSON file(s). Usability concepts to meet the needs of users and design principles to enhance the appearance of the web site are also expected. The proposal must thoroughly describe the project to be built, including:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>The purpose of the project from a content delivery point of view.</li>
					<li>The target audience and persona for the project;</li>
					<li>A list and description of the web pages to be built (minimum of 5 content pages). Clearly indicate which page will hold your content video.</li>
					<li>Two wireframe sketches of a typical content page for small and large screens. Be sure to add detail to the sketches to clearly indicate the type of content (text, images, video, etc...) and layout on various devices.</li>
					<li>Usability concepts you will include in the site to ease site use for visitors.</li>
					<li>Be an HTML document.</li>
					<li>Be submitted to the Project Proposal dropbox (in the week 08 folder) during week 08.</li>

				</ol>
				<p>A <a href="/230d2l/resources/proposal_outline.docx.zip" title="Download a zip file of a proposal outline" target="_blank">sample proposal outline</a> is available for your use.</p>

				<p>Professor response will be in one of the following forms:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Approved</strong> – you may proceed with the project as proposed.</li>
					<li><strong>Modify</strong> – you must make modifications to the project proposal as indicated and resubmit the modified proposal to the professor.</li>
					<li><strong>Denied</strong> – the project does not meet the requirements or is too large or small of scope. You must submit a new proposal.</li>
				</ol>
