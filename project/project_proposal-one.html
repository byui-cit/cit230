				<h1>Project Proposal I</h1>

				<p>The first step in creating your project proposal is to choose a subject for your site.You should review the <a href="requirements.html" target="_blank">requirements</a> for the project as you consider your topic.  Remember especially that you will need to pull some of the information from your site from an external JSON file.</p>
				<p>Once you have thought of a subject write down the 5 pages you will make with a few details about the content each of those pages will hold.  If you have a hard time coming up with 5 pages with good content, you may want to reconsider your topic.  If you have a hard time keeping it to <strong>only</strong> 5 pages...you might also want to reconsider...;)</p>
				<h2>Tasks</h2>

				<ol>
					<li>Create a new html file to become the start of your proposal. Add to it the critical HTML and semantic structural elements.</li>
					<li>Add a section describing your subject and the purpose of the site.  Be specific!</li>
					<li>Add a second section with the list of 5 content pages along with a short description of what will be on each page.</li>
					<li>Validate your page and add a link to the proposal to your Temporary Homepage.</li>
					<li>Submit the URL to your site in Ilearn.</li>
					

				</ol>
