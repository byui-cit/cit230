        <h1>Web Project Requirements</h1>
        <p>The course project is <strong>the major project</strong> of the semester and is representative of all topics and objectives of the course. The use of code taken from textbooks, video courses and other outside resources is not allowed (although the ideas and concepts from these resources is encouraged). All work must be your own, but you are encouraged to work with your peers.</p>
        
        <p>The project must include all of the following:</p>

          <li>Folders and files (all types) must follow the web naming rules.</li>
          <li>All pages (including the planning and homework pages) will have meaningful, content specific titles.</li>

          <li>No horizontal scrolling and zooming will be needed to view content (This does not apply for content that scrolls within a container in order to display a sequential series of values, but must NOT apply to the entire page).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Objective 3</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Usability enhancing techniques must be implemented throughout the site.</li>

          <li>Site images must be optimized and delivered using responsive media techniques appropriate to screen size and/or density and operating environment.</li>
          <li>At least 1 video of your own creation and representative of your site content must be delivered using the HTML video element.</li>
          <li>The design principals of Proximity, Alignment, Repetition, Contrast and Typography must be recognized and used in the visual styling of the site.</li>
          <li>The visual appearance of all pages (including the planning and homework pages) in the site must be uniform and consistent.</li>

          <li>A link to the homework document must be found in the footer of all site pages.</li>
          <li>Modularization is used in all web pages to provide common content (header, navigation and footer) throughout the site.</li>
          <li>Navigation must be fully operational and adapt to screen size and all links must be operational.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Objective 5</h2>
